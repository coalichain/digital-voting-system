The Role of Blockchain Technology in Digital Voting System

In order to tabulate results faster, reduce costs and reduce paper expenses in several countries, digital voting has been implemented through the well-known <a href="https://www.coalichain.io/images/pdf/coalichain.pdf">Electronic Voting Machines</a>.

Regrettably, it has been shown that their system is vulnerable and does not guarantee the transparency of suffrage.

**What to do then?**

The <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-blockchain-help-in-online-political-voting-democracy-914580df30cd">BlockChain technology</a> is applicable to many fields beyond finance, among which is the electoral system. In fact, the debate on the viability of its implementation was opened before the last elections in North America and in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership">European Union</a>.

**What role would this technology play in electronic voting?**

Elections would be irrefutably transparent if the results were verifiable, auditable and safe. Something difficult to guarantee in the votes on paper where it is impossible to verify the authenticity of all the ballots that are counted; and in the digital vote because hackers can intercept communications and modify or even eliminate them.

By implementing the BlockChain technology in the electoral system, voters could vote from home through the Internet using an ID issued by the State. Each vote would be recorded and encrypted in the book of records designed for that purpose, and the results would be read in real time.

BlockChain's own cryptography would protect every vote against manipulation and alteration, keeping it immutable and guaranteeing the security of information and the transparency of elections.

One drawback in implementing digital voting with this technology lies in the application of the principle that the vote must be secret. Given the nature of Blockchain, within the protocol, transactions are stored who sent the vote, but not from where, therefore the problem of privacy lies there, in which the author of the vote is saved and that is public.

**Overview**

There are two main target audiences for <a href="https://www.coalichain.io/">Coalichain</a>. The voters and the candidates (both current and potential politicians, elected officials, leaders, etc.)

If you are a voter who wants to join **Coalichain**, you will register and identify yourself (using best- of- breed KYC). Each Coalichain user and potential voter will have a unique and (thanks to the Distributed Ledger Technology of blockchain) virtually impossible - to - tamper - with Coalichain profile and identity. Coalichain users can also become candidates. They can use the many features on the app (see below) to present themselves to the voters and try to rally support. They can use the app to raise money, build a network, publish their opinions and more.

The key aspect of **Coalichain** is smart contract - based accountability. The first stage of implementing accountability would be based on a "carrot and stick" strategy Voters will be able to condition (thanks to smart contracts and crypto) donations with real results. For example, promise to donate money if a certain bill is passed (the "carrot").

At the same time, voters can impose a fine on the candidate if he fails to uphold his promises. The details of this mechanism are described below.

We hope you are starting to see the bigger picture. **Coalichain** is a platform for fair and free elections and politics. It gives power to the people and "levels the playing field" with the powerful interest groups. It will incentivize a new generation of effective leaders with a true mandate from the people.

From the candidates' point of view, this type of direct contractual relationship with the voters, means she will not need millions to fund her campaign. Logistics will be simplified. This technology is making it possible for a candidate to communicate, interact and transact with a large public without needing for mass- media outlets. The platform will reduce the cost of elections by a factor of 10 (and up to 100 in certain countries). It means candidates will be freed from the "vice" of the wealthy power - groups and it will reduce the risk (or certainty) of corruption.

**Coalichain** will be active year - round and not only around elections. It will serve as a direct one - to - many channel of communication and will l allow elected representatives to communicate directly with their potential voters about both daily matters, and especially around significant decisions.

**Election Setup and Voting**

**Coalichain's** voting tool is easy to use, adaptable and secure. It can be used for any type of election (local government, national government, corporate board, unions, etc.), to vote for candidates, or on polls and surveys. 

To maintain the integrity and safety of votes and prevent fraud, both voters and candidates registering to the platform go through a rigorous verification and authentication process, that is recorded on the blockchain and creates a unique ID for each user. Before voting, voters go through a second authentication process. The use f blockchain for authentication, as well as voting itself, makes sure no one can tamper with votes, polls or petitions - not even the platform itself.
